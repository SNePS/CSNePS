CSNePS - Concurrent SNePS
======

CSNePS is an implementation (and extension of) of the <a href="http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/sneps/Projects/sneps3.html">SNePS 3</a> knowledge representation and reasoning system specification. CSNePS is written in the Clojure programming language, and is designed to utilize concurrency during inference. 

While CSNePS is still under heavy development, the version available here should be usable. There is some documentation (including setup instructions) provided in the manual.pdf file in the doc folder,  but most documentation is currently in the form of papers written about SNePS 3 and portions of CSNePS. 

If you intend to use CSNePS it is best to first aquiant yourself with the SNePS 3 specification:

Next, you should aquiant yourself with Inference Graphs, which provide the natural deduction and subsumption reasoning abilities of CSNePS.
